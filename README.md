#### Setting Up Local Database
- Install and set up postgresql, if not already installed. You can visit this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-ruby-on-rails-application-on-ubuntu-14-04) for information on how to install postgresql.
- Create a file named `.env` in the `server` directory according to the `.env-example` file, and add the relevant database credentials.

- To start the client, open the terminal and inside the project root folder type the following 
```
cd client
yarn install
yarn start
```
- Open another tab in the terminal(CTRL+SHIFT+T) and type the following to run server
```
cd server
yarn install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
yarn server
```
- The client site will open in the browser at http://localhost:3000/.
